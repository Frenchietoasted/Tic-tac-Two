The game of Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun game, but often when two players who know what they're doing face off, the game devolves into a drawfest.

This version aims to solve that issue by only allowing players to have **3 pieces per player**, and after that they must move the first piece they placed.  
This repeats until someone wins â€” by luck or skill.

### Made entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery)
